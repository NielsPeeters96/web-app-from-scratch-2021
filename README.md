Search for a location and click on search. Very straightforward.
  
##  ⚙️ Installation
How to get the API-key etc. Will be added later ⏰

## 📦 API Endpoint Structure
What's inside the API (structure/objects). Will be added later ⏰

## 📝 Todo list (in no specific order)

- [ ] **Error handling for users.** Give them feedback: are there no flights? Did they miss something? Did they fill in the wrong airport. Maybe the API-key is not working correctly (anymore), and they get an 401. Besides that: JS stops running when there is an error. When that happens, the app stops working (until you reload). Not a good UX imo.
- [x] **Let users fill in the location instead of the Airport Code**. More common that you search for `Amsterdam` instead of `AMS`. Make that happen.
- [ ] **Make the detail modal dynamic**. It's already dynamic now, but JS is creating a modal for every card, while one modal (that updates based on the data) is enough.
- [ ] **Let the user choose their currency**. It's standard EUR now, but why not make it dynamic.
- [ ] **Let the user choose between only direct flights**. Maybe a checkbox and it can also be displayed on the details modal.
- [ ] **Improve the details modal**. It's boring right now. Add extra (useful) information and redesign it.
- [ ] **Add modules**. Make it more readable.
- [ ] **Come up with new ideas and add those in the README**. Ongoing 🙃
